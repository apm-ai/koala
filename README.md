Koala is a next-generation APM backend for @open-telemetry, written in go and rust.It's 100% open-source ,fully functional, and maybe one of the best full-stack APM solution for micro-service applications.

Koala is based on @open-telemetry, so it supports **tracing,metrics and logs** at the same place, and can deliver visualization, data correlation and smart analysis to you.

Koala also supports **pinpoint** format data, it's compatible with OpenTelemetry-format, so you can use pinpoint-agent to collect java data for powerful instrumenting.

Built in Go/Rust, Koala places high-value on performance, correctness, and  concurrency. It compiles to  several static binary and is very easy for deployment.

## Current Status
OpenTelemetry reached beta now, so this project will be restart.


## Features

* ***Fast*** - Built in Go/Rust, Koala is blistering fast and memory efficient.
* **OpenSource** - Koala is 100% open-source, no commercial-version in the future!
* **Full Visibility** - See every aspect of your applications and users in real-time
* **Traces,Metris &Logs** - Unifies traces, logs and metrics in the core system,based on @open-telemetry
* **Smart** - AI powered APM delivers the intelligent analysis and alert.
* **Multi Data Types Supported** - We support @open-telemetry and @pinpoint at the sametime
* **Beutiful UI** - Koala has beautiful admin UI and it's also very interactive

## Roadmap

| Milestone  | Name | Description|
|:------|:------------:| :----: |
| **V0.1** | Server-side agent | Collect opentelemetry data , send them to Koala-Collector |
| **V0.2** | Tracing Support |  Collect,process and visualize tracing data. | 
| **V0.3** | Tracing Metrics Support | Extract general metrics from tracing data, such as url, sql, exception, method etc, visualize them in dashboard |
| **V0.4** |  Alerting | Build complex alerting logic using multiple trigger conditions, push alerts to multiple providers(sms, email etc)
| **V0.5** |Dependency Analyzing| Analyze the dependency data(server,url), output the server-map and url-map) |
| **V0.6** | Metrics Support | Collect infrastructure and user-define metrics,correlate them with tracing data, output metrics to popular metrics storages |
| **V0.7** | Pinpoint supported | 1. Modified pinpoint-agent.jar to support OpenTelemery 2. Convert pinpoint-format to opentelemetry-format | 
| **V1.0** | **Production Ready**  | Test in real production environment for at least 6 weeks, fix all critical bugs | 
| **Future** | Logs Support | Collect logs in Koala-Agent(integrated with filebeat etc), correlate logs with tracing and metrcs, output logs to popular metrics storages, visualize and search them in Koala-Dashboard | 


We are now working at V0.1 and V0.2,it depends on the progress of OpenTelemetry's go sdk.
